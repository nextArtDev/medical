Some databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server, do not natively support array types like `String[]` in Prisma.

In that case, you can use a separate model to store the time slots, and create a many-to-one relationship between the time slots and the booking. Here's an example:

```prisma
model Booking {
  id       String   @id @default(cuid())
  timeSlots TimeSlot[]
}

model TimeSlot {
  id       String   @id @default(cuid())
  time     String
  booking  Booking @relation(fields: [id], references: [id])
}
```

This way, you can store each time slot as a separate record in the `TimeSlot` table, and link it to the corresponding booking using the `booking` field.

You can then create a time slot like this:

```typescript
const timeSlot = await prisma.timeSlot.create({
  data: {
    time: "08:30",
    booking: { connect: { id: booking.id } },
  },
});
```

And retrieve all time slots for a booking like this:

```typescript
const timeSlots = await prisma.timeSlot.findMany({
  where: { booking: { id: booking.id } },
});
```

Alternatively, you can use a JSON field to store the time slots as an array of strings. This is supported by some databases, such as PostgreSQL and MySQL (with the JSON column type). Here's an example:

```prisma
model Booking {
  id       String   @id @default(cuid())
  timeSlots Json
}
```

You can then store the time slots as an array of strings like this:

```typescript
const booking = await prisma.booking.create({
  data: {
    timeSlots: '["08:00", "08:30", "09:00"]',
  },
});
```

And retrieve the time slots like this:

```typescript
const booking = await prisma.booking.findUnique({
  where: { id: booking.id },
});
const timeSlots = JSON.parse(booking.timeSlots);
```

Note that using a JSON field can be less efficient than using a separate table for the time slots, especially if you need to query or index the time slots.





<!-- String[] support  -->
In that case, you can create a Prisma model that has an array of time slots, and each time slot can be represented as a DateTime object. However, since you want to store only the time component without the date, you can use a string field to store the time in a specific format, for example, "HH:mm".

Here's an example of how you can define your Prisma model:

```prisma
model Booking {
  id       String   @id @default(cuid())
  timeSlots String[]
}
```

In your React application, you can create an array of time slots and store them in the Prisma model. Here's an example:

```typescript
const timeSlots = ["08:00", "08:30", "09:00", "09:30", "10:00"];

const booking = await prisma.booking.create({
  data: {
    timeSlots,
  },
});
```

When someone books a time slot, you can remove that time slot from the array and update the Prisma model. Here's an example:

```typescript
const bookedTimeSlot = "08:30";
const updatedTimeSlots = timeSlots.filter((timeSlot) => timeSlot !== bookedTimeSlot);

const updatedBooking = await prisma.booking.update({
  where: { id: booking.id },
  data: {
    timeSlots: updatedTimeSlots,
  },
});
```

You can also add a separate model to store the booked time slots, for example:

```prisma
model BookedTimeSlot {
  id       String   @id @default(cuid())
  time     String
  booking  Booking @relation(fields: [id], references: [id])
}
```

This way, you can store additional information about the booked time slot, such as the user who booked it, the date it was booked, etc.

Here's an example of how you can create a booked time slot:

```typescript
const bookedTimeSlot = await prisma.bookedTimeSlot.create({
  data: {
    time: "08:30",
    booking: { connect: { id: booking.id } },
  },
});
```

You can then query the booked time slots for a specific booking like this:

```typescript
const bookedTimeSlots = await prisma.bookedTimeSlot.findMany({
  where: { booking: { id: booking.id } },
});
```
